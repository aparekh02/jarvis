## üîß Environment Variables

Your `.env` file should look like:

```env
# Required for full AI features
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key-here

# Optional for classroom sync
VITE_GOOGLE_CLASSROOM_API_KEY=your-google-key-here

# Alternative voice APIs (pick one)
# VITE_GOOGLE_SPEECH_API_KEY=your-google-speech-key
# VITE_AZURE_SPEECH_KEY=your-azure-key
# VITE_AZURE_SPEECH_REGION=eastus
# VITE_ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY=your-assemblyai-key
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors
- This occurs when `import.meta.env` is undefined
- Make sure you have a `.env` file in your project root
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your API keys
- Restart your development server completely (Ctrl+C then restart)

### "API key not configured" errors
- Check that your `.env` file is in the project root (same level as `package.json`)
- Ensure variable names start with `VITE_` (required for Vite)
- Make sure there are no quotes around your API keys in the .env file
- Restart your development server after adding keys
- Check browser console: API keys should appear in `import.meta.env`

### Voice features not working
- Grant microphone permissions in browser (click the microphone icon in address bar)
- Try different browsers (Chrome/Edge work best for Web Speech API)
- Check browser console for specific errors
- Test with and without OpenAI API key (fallback modes available)

### AI features not working
- Verify OpenAI API key is valid and starts with `sk-`
- Check you have credits remaining in your OpenAI account
- Make sure you're not hitting rate limits (try waiting a few minutes)
- Check browser network tab for 401/403 errors from OpenAI API

### Environment Variable Debugging
Add this to your component to debug:
```javascript
console.log('Environment check:', {
  hasEnv: !!import.meta.env,
  openaiKey: import.meta.env?.VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY ? 'Found' : 'Missing',
  classroomKey: import.meta.env?.VITE_GOOGLE_CLASSROOM_API_KEY ? 'Found' : 'Missing'
})
```

## üîí Security Notes

- Never commit API keys to version control
- Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file
- Use environment variables in production
- Rotate keys periodically for security

## üí° Tips

- Start with OpenAI for best experience
- Web Speech API works offline as backup
- Monitor API usage in provider dashboards
- Consider caching responses to reduce costs
